# Getting Started

MoneyScript is a *structured format* for business plans.
It's easy to create, and easy to understand -- yet it sets out a business
plan as precisely as any spreadsheet (and with less room for mistakes).

Although it looks like normal English, MoneyScript does have strict rules. 
Below we show you how it works by example. 
There is also a manual (TODO) and a help forum (TODO).

## Basic Example

This shows (1) how to create rows, and (2) how to use them in simple formulas.
The plan will run for 2 years by default. The formulas are calculated on a monthly basis.

	Buy: £9
	Sell: £10
	Customers: 100
	Income: Customers * (Sell - Buy)
	Balance: sum Income

## Intermediate Example

This shows (1) groups-of-rows, created by indenting the sub-rows.
(2) uncertain quantities, created using +-.

	Costs:
		Studio Rent: £10k per year
		Materials: £500 per week		
		Electricity: £100 per month	
			
	Sales: 500 +- 100
	Income:	£5 * Sales

	// When a group	is used in a formula, we add up the rows within that group
	Cashflow: Income - Costs

## Advanced Example

columns: 36 months

// You can use css to style the spreadsheet cells
Cashflow if < 0: {color:red;}
Balance: {font-weight:bold;}

## Advanced Rows: Using Filters

Staff:
	Alice:
	Bob:




## Advanced Formulas

## Replacing versus Stacking

	// Here, when the 2nd rule kicks in, it will completely replace the 1st rule.
	Alice: £20k per year
	Alice from year 2: £22k per year

	// Here, when the 2nd rule kicks in, it will be stacked after the 1st.
	// So from year 2, Alice's salary becomes £20k * 110%
	Alice: £20k per year
	Alice from year 2: * 110%


### Sum
In this example, Balance is the sum of Profit from start uptil the current point:

	Profit: £1 per month
	Balance: sum Profit
	
In this example, we use the keyword `above` to sum upwards instead:
			
	Costs: £1 per month
	Income: £2 per month
	Profit: sum above

### TODO Plans that change over time
