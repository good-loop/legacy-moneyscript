MoneyScript is case sensitive.
It is an error to have names that are the same-except-for-capitalisation.
Row names start with a capital letter. They cannot include ,:+-*/ or keywords. They can include spaces.
Columns are always time.

Global variables: row, column - both integers

MoneyScript commands are of the form
Selector: Rule
E.g. 
Director: £50k per year

The Selector picks out a cell, a row, or a set of rows
E.g.
Row name - selects all cells in that row, moving left to right
Row name from 2011 - selects Jan 2011 and later
Row name to 2011
Row 1, Row 2 - comma separated list of Selectors - selects both rows
Group name - selects all rows in that group

Use whitespace indentation for grouping, e.g.

Staff:
	Alice:
	Bob:

Dangling column selectors - use "from 2011:" to affect all subsequent statements. 

Reference other sheets by url
url scheme http://whatever.com/myfile#Selector

A Rule can begin =, in which case all previous rules for that row are dropped.
Otherwise rules stack.

Rule is a number, e.g. 2, -£10
Or a formula, e.g. (sum of Sales) + VAT
Or a reference, e.g. "Dan: = Joe" gives Dan the same salary as Joe
Rules can use Selectors

Filters:
	money - ignores non-currency rows
	

Use {css} for display styling

Comments - use // comment

Conditionals - bit more traditional code syntax

if (Sales > 10) {
	Staff: +£100 // bonus
	if (New Hire = 0) New Hire: £24k per year
} else {
	Old Bob from now: = 0
}
	
This test would get run every step!
